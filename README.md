Today university in the United states are studying how music affects the human brain gym tender as the 

story
It doesn’t matter whether you play a guitar piano classical music or maybe you like to play this kind of 
music Just it will do good things for your body because we’ve known for sometime that playing a musical 
instrument can change the anatomy as well as the function the way that the brain works Meena Krause 
is a professor at Northwestern University near Chicago nau so the head of the auditory neuroscience 
laboratory where she investigates how music affects the human body recently tests in her lab using 45 
volunteers some of them had taken music classes and played an instrument and others play study a 
musical instrument for some time in their lives and then that’s it and we wanted to know did this early 
experience have a lasting effect on the way the nervous system responded to sound professor Kraus 
began by gently placing electrodes onto the heads of the volunteers nerves in your brain electricity and 
we can capture that electricity and we can determine how does your nervous system respond to speech 
to music true elements of sound that we think are important for communication one of the simplest 
sounds played for the volunteers the sound is very short and quick stop after the human brain process 
the sound it sounded like this that sound came through the computer and was played on a speaker 
again the volunteers also heard other sounds this music from the British rock group deep purple smoke 
on the water listen carefully after going through the brain of a volunteer the second first but it provided 
the information needed to be studied on a computer screen in the way the processed sounds looked 
these young adults who received formal music instruction in children had more robust neural responses 
to sound then peers who had never participated in music lessons computer screen and easily see who 
was the musician and who was not the computer screen play music every sound we here fundamental 
frequency this helps us determine the pitch in music that helps us decide if one sound or musical node is 
higher or lower than another so for a musician the responses to this fundamental frequency that carries 
pitch information was simply larger in magnitude the voltage is the electrical activity was larger in 
response to these pitch elements professor Kraus says the people tested in the experiment could have 
been listening to any kind of so she could still see how their brains were understanding and identifying 
what they were here Musicians are different from those of other people what is the big deal why is this 
important according to Nina Krause that matters a lot as we get older many people notice that as the 
years go by there hearing gets worse system automatically good at responding to sounds that the brain 
has learned are important so if you are talking to me in a noisy restaurant and my nervous system is very 
good at locking on to the sound of your voice then I’m going to be better able to understand what it is 
that you say Northwestern University shows that playing a musical instrument is good for your brain and 
although our years may not work as well as we age that helps us to hear better musicians become quite 
good at being able to pull out the part of the sound that they are interested in listening to for example 
the sound of their own instrument Our brains get better at remembering things our brains to remember 
the note we just play if your brain could talk or is it this one should I play the notes does this sound 
better with a major chord a happy or sell we are exercising and making important electrical connections 
for pathways in our brains this might even help our brains when we're trying to learn another language 
or a new subject in school so professor Kraus says she has yet to test that proposal but we know that 
pushing ourselves physically or intellectually is very good for the development of the nervous system 
certainly the more challenging that aft and the more engaging the task the stronger the connections are 
likely to be
